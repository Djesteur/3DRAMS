3DRAMS is a software for view and edit 3ds ram from a pc, using wifi connection.
Based on this version of Luma3DS: https://github.com/Nanquitas/Luma3DS/releases/
Plugin file (.3gx) must be placed in sd:/luma/plugin/
The plugin need to be launch for communicating with the software (press Select once the game is launched).
A big thank you to Nanquitas and PabloMK7 for their help on Discord.

For building pc software: use qmake, then make (Qt is needed).

V0.1.0: User can connect to plugin and get a range of value. 
/!\ If the range is to big, the plugin seems to crash. In fact, it's just taking a lot of time for the plugin. I'm currently working on it.

I'm not providing more assitance for the moment because the software isn't stable and not ready to be used by anyone.
